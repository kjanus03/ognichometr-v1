# ognichometr_v1
### **I strongly discourage using this app, it's rather the kind not to share with the world.**
Ognichometr - a simple measurement app that attempts to calculate how good a given day is for a casual campfire. The app takes into consideration weather conditions, whether a given day falls on a weekend and even astronomical events. May be a bit obsolote - it was made with 2021 in mind. 
##### I was biting more than I could chew with this project. Most of the practices in the code and graphic design are that of beginners.
This project was a massive learning opportunity. 
Written in Python 3 with use of PyGuiUI module - should be usable with a Graphic User Interface as a Windows app.
